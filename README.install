Installation Instructions
-------------------------

IRBEM-LIB has a makefile setup to automatically build the library.
The following steps should be taken to build and install IRBEM-LIB.

        1. Set your current directory (cd) to the top level IRBEM-LIB
	 directory.

        2. Compile/link the distribution.  First enter...

              make all.help

           For example, to build the distribution on a SunOS system using
           the gnu Fortran compiler enter...

              make OS=sunos ENV=gnu64 all

           The `OS' and `ENV' variables are described in the `make all.help'
           part of this step.

        3. Install the libraries.
	   First enter...

              make install.help

           to determine the required/optional `make' variables to be used.
           Then enter...

              make `make variables...' install

           The appropriate files will be copied to the `matlab'
           and top level IRBEM-LIB directories (from the `source/...'
           directory).

           For example, to install the distribution in `/usr/local/irbem_lib'
           enter...

              make INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/irbem_lib install

           The `INSTALLDIR' variable is described in the `make install.help'
           part of this step.

        4. Test that the distribution was built correctly by entering...
	   First enter...

              make test.help

           to determine the required/optional `make' variables to be used.
           Then enter...


              make `make variables...' test

           The name of each test executed and results will be displayed.

        5. Delete the library(s), object files, and executables in the
           `source/...' directory by entering...

              make clean
